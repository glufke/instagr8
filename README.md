# msx-instagr8
I will save here the files for MSX Instagram for GR8NET

For now, watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-G7gzgepdA

INSTRUCTIONS
* Download the file INSTAGR8.BAS and save in a floppy disk or SD card for your MSX.
* In BASIC, execute with:
LOAD "INSTAGR8.BAS",R

WHAT IS NEEDED:
You need only the cartridge GR8NET. It doesn't matter what SETMAP it is configured.
Its needed also a server (you can use mine: IP http://54.201.73.96).

HOW IT WORKS
MSX computers run at 3.56mhz. Its virtually impossible to a MSX to connect into HTTPS and retrieve huge JSON files and images from the Instagram API, and convert it to SCREEN2.
That's why a server is needed in the middle, to make all the heavy work.
